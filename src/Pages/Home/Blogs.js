                        I can improve the perfomance of a reacr application by doing these techniques which are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Using React.Fragment to Avoid Adding Extra Nodes to the DOM.</li>
                            <li>2. By Ignoring Anonymous Functions.</li>
                            <li>3. Use A Production Build Before Deployment.</li>
                            <li>4. By Mounting And Unmounting Components.</li>
                            <li>5. Using React.memo for Component Memoization.</li>
                        </ul>

                        HTML: A good basis for accessibility?
                    </p>
                    <p class='text-gray-600'>
                        A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making
                        sure the correct HTML elements are always used for the correct
                        purpose.

                        CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices?
                    </p>
                    <p class='text-gray-600'>
                        CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to
                        allow for accessible web experiences, but if misused they can
                        significantly harm accessibility. This article outlines some CSS and
                        JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure that
                        even complex content is as accessible as possible.

                        Following on from the previous article, sometimes making complex UI
                        controls that involve unsemantic HTML and dynamic JavaScript-updated
                        content can be difficult. WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help
                        with such problems by adding in further semantics that browsers and
                        assistive technologies can recognize and use to let users know what
                        is going on. Here we'll show how to use it at a basic level to
                        improve accessibility.

                        Another category of content that can create accessibility problems
                        is multimedia â€” video, audio, and image content need to be given
                        proper textual alternatives, so they can be understood by assistive
                        technologies and their users. This article shows how.
